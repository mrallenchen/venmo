Project Description:
Goal: To understand what type of transactions take place on venmo. Has this changed over time? For example, during football season, there could be betting/fantasy football pools that have transacations for football. Post-covid, Has there been a change in the social outings, rent/utilities payments?

Can I detect tips and professional jobs on Venmo? Then once I figure that out, can I see what they are doing…. And has that changed?


Can I identify superusers? What transactions are the superusers doing? 

e.g. Venmo for haircuts…

Data source:
Using the venmo api, can search for users by name and then pull transactions (last 50 transactions) for each user.
Each transaction includes a date and a note.
